# 👋 Hi, I’m Timothy Mosby  

**Software engineer chasing the space between the digital and the real.**  

I’ve spent over a decade building mobile applications and websites that reach millions of users, most recently as a senior engineer at Getty Images. My current explorations focus on AR/MR/VR and computer vision, with prototypes like **AirType**, **CountAR**, and **FaceTrackAR**.  

I’m especially drawn to challenges at the intersection of physical and digital — whether in spatial computing, satellites, or other frontier technologies that reshape how people interact with the world.
