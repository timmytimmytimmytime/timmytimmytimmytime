# Timothy Mosby  

**Software engineer chasing the space between the digital and the real.**  

I‚Äôve spent over a decade building mobile applications and websites that reach millions of users, most recently as a senior engineer at Getty Images.  

My current explorations focus on AR/VR and computer vision, with prototypes like  [AirType](https://github.com/timmytimmytimmytime/AirType), [CountAR](), and [FaceTrackAR](https://github.com/timmytimmytimmytime/FaceMoCap). I‚Äôm especially drawn to challenges at the intersection of physical and digital ‚Äî whether in spatial computing, satellites, or other frontier technologies that reshape how people interact with the world.
