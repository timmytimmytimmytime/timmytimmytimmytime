**Software engineer chasing the space between the digital and the real.**  

I've spent over a decade building mobile applications and websites that reach millions of users, most recently as a senior engineer at Getty Images. I continue to deepen my mobile expertise, currently focused on modern Swift/SwiftUI development and cross-platform architecture with Flutter/Dart across iOS, Android, and web.
